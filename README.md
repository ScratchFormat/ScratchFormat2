ScratchFormat is a browser extension created in 2017 to make Scratch comments  
a little bit less boring. The current version includes Markdown formatting,  
breakline detection, a linkifier, and much more.

This repo is a complete rewrite from Scratch, very fast and small compared  
to the older versions.

## QNA:
```
That's a very good idea, but sadly, if I write for instance something in red (the word "test"), 
I see it red, but me alone (or the other user of this addons), other people see "[color=red]Test[/color] " . 
So it makes this addons not useful at all. Please fix it, as the starting idea was good.
--
It works, but only for people who have install this extension ...
--
Only people who have this extension installed can see the text. Other will see all those tags!
```

There have been many requests for ScratchFormat to work for people who do  
not have the extension installed. If you think about it, this is obviously  
impossible, there is nothing I can do about it.  

Yes, there are UTF-8 "fonts" out there, and you can technically translate to them,  
but it is way too impractical and complex for a simple chat.  

And with the color tag, it is simply a toy. Where would it be practical? The real use  
is with bold, italics, and maybe code. Everything else is extra.  

As a side note:  
SFCode is the original formatting system, made in 2017. Since it is complex  
and hard to read for people who don't have the extension, Markdown support was  
added, but support for SFCode is maintained.
